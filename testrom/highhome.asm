VBlankBusyWait::
	; same as DelayFrame, but it can be called in di mode
	; and therefore burns through the CPU
	; unless the LCD is disabled, in which case we don't care, and we return carry to tell the caller that we don't care
	; basically the only practical use ever for this function is actually waiting to disable the LCD, so the carry flag doesn't matter
	; but we get the flag for free, since it comes from the control flow, so why not
	; well I guess it's not as free if we need a ccf, but I'm too lazy to change the flow now
	; this function has a lot of comments, doesn't it
